spip
=====

**spip** is a little utility that polls remote servers to see if your IP has changed and if it has - updates DNS record associated with it.

# Current status

**Proof of concept**

- works with AWS Route53 only
- inconsistent interface (some parameters passed as ENVVARS, hostname with CLI args)
- probably too verbose
- no parameters / customisation

# TODO

All the above :)
